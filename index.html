"Working with the entire Adams Southeastern Construction team was great.  Everyone involved in the project not only brought expertise and experience but also suggested several solutions to keep our project focused and on budget.  Amazingly, our office was able to stay open for most of the project with very little disruption in daily work flow.  Our patients love the new office and it definitely would not have been possible without the outstanding service and honest work supplied by Adams Southeastern Construction.  Thanks guys!!"</p>

                        <p> Trace was excellent at making sure we got the things we desired in our building and finding ways to save money without sacrificing quality.  In fact, on our last project, Trace finished our project just below his contracted amount even though we added almost $50,000 in additions to the building during the process.  I was amazed and thankful.  Trace is not just a builder.  He is a friend and a mentor.  Without his help, I am positive that our dental practice would not be where it is today.  Thanks Trace!"</p>

Not only did Trace complete our project ahead of time, but he helped me keep it on budget with a lot of his design ideas.  This was extremely important due to our budget constraints.  Unlike other builders that complete your project and you never hear from again, Trace and his team have
